IMPORTANT SIDENOTE: Recently, my hard drive unexpectedly broke, so this is not the full code. 
After retrieving back the info from my hard drive, I will upload it back on here.
However, the most important file was thankfully saved and is added here on this github repository.

My madman's recipe generator makes use of the rita.js library and my own context-free grammar.
It also creates a colored amalgamation based on the number of spicy/neutral/sweet ingredients.
The sweeter the overall recipe, the lovelier the whole batch looks.
